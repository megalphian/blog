description: Last month, I moved to Waterloo for a multitude of reasons, so I
  wanted to write about it! This move was accompanied by a mental journey on
  setting myself a meaningful metric.

So 2020 didn't turn out as expected! I remember celebrating the start of 2020 thinking it was going to be a new era. It did turn out to be one: *the* *pandemic era.* I called it the *Lonely Island era* without the well-placed musical humour. (If you know, you know!)

With all the measures taken to curb Covid, it was challenging to be in a single-household. Every day was mundane with absolutely no human contact. I swore that the next year wasn't going to be like that, so I started looking for opportunities to grow myself not only as a person but also as someone who was interested in robotics and wants to make a career out of it.

After a lot of soul searching, emailing, and one accepted application, I got into a research master's program at the University of Waterloo, where I can study path planning algorithms in robotics! It was exciting, motivating, terrifying and paralyzing all at the same time. On one hand, I was going into a field that has always excited and challenged me. On the other, I was moving out of my comfort zone while the world already didn't feel too comfortable.

Thinking back on this, it wasn't even a question: I needed to do this! I was at a local optimum and I had to move to a different spot to see if I was at the globally optimal point. Maybe there was a better point. Maybe not. But it's tough to know for sure without some exploration. While I still miss my incredibly comfortable 1B apartment in downtown Edmonton, maybe I can *be more* from a student dorm room in a new city.

But throughout the duration of my move, I thought about my definition of *being more.* I took courses and began my research project from Edmonton and it was a difficult shift in my everyday life. I was mentally burnt out from being alone in Covid, handling a grad school courseload and studying math after 2 years. I thought that maybe it wasn't for me? I got around the 60s in the first assignment I wrote after undergrad, while I was used to scoring in the 90s. Should I even bother moving? Maybe I've gotten dumb?

But I haven't. It's worth feeling dumb because it forces you to *change your metric*. If you measure yourself not by what you could've accomplished, but by what you do accomplish every day, the game is rigged in your favour. I did something extra: I considered my burnout in my metric. Relaxing the game not only gave me the space to realize that I was working on some fascinating topics but also to appreciate my willingness to understand these topics.

I wanted to continue exploring this thought. I finished my first semester and sat down to write down my goals for the next semester. I was taking up a reduced course load to focus on my research and lockdown the specifics of my project. But my mind immediately went to all the extracurriculars I can do: start a company, work on some side projects, participate in hackathons, etc. Not a second to waste...except that this failed my metric. I wanted to be fulfilled by the work I do, and I'm just new to the field. I didn't feel that half-working on many projects was a good way to improve my confidence, so my metric is now to focus on my project but take multiple approaches to the same problem. This has worked incredibly well in helping me learn more from my research and feeling the end of my burnout.

I'm now in my dorm room, after a day that wasn't incredibly productive, and I don't feel completely lost like I used to. My metric motivates me to continue learning every day and respects the variables in my life. My metric changes with every new situation. With my metric, I can appreciate my life with no guilt and that's when I truly feel like I *am more* ;)
