description: Piloting a blog that I built for my website
---
I'm excited to be blogging again! I last used a WordPress blog, but I never built my own one. This one is built in Gridsome and it seems like it's running fine in all platforms. And considering I'm not really a web dev, I'm excited to be posting about my thoughts and projects here and share it with everyone!

Plus the website doesn't seem to build correctly without a Hello World post, so...

# **HELLO WORLD!!**
