description: Running thoughts on the upcoming insanely busy weeks
---
I now find myself at a point in my PhD program where my metal will be tested in the next 2-3 weeks. While a part of me wants to ignore the challenge and watch NBA games, another part keeps pushing me to face what's coming. I'm finding that writing down these thoughts could help the latter part and potentially come out of these weeks in flying colours so I'm going to do that.

**November 9, 2021:**

Here are the two biggest things I have going on now:

* Preparing for my PhD background examination 2 weeks from now (AHHHHHHHHH)
* Working on my course project due in 3.5 weeks (AHHHhhh)

The first point is almost a month in the works, but thinking about the sheer amount of possible questions is anxiety-inducing. I feel that I am putting in the effort to do alright in the exam, but the possibilty of flunking it as I read more material is not pleasant to think about. 

A little insight into my thought process; when I think about failure, I tend to think of it as an absolute certainty. This makes me prepare twice as hard, and eventually avoid it and feel a sense of relief. However, the prep for the exam is challenging this approach where I can't completely eliminate failure or success. The uncertainty of it all is the challenge, and I would need to switch my approach to deal with this better.

As for the second point; I am working on it regularly and pushing bit-by-bit with the hope that it'll be done before the deadline. I think that I should be taking this tactic with the exam prep too. Just keep pushing until the resulting work is somewhat acceptable? Let's try it for the next couple days

**November 21, 2021:**

Two days before my background exam! After 2 weeks of alternating intense study days and lazy days, I realize one thing...

My thought process that I wrote about two weeks ago is not exactly incorrect but needed some fixing. It is impossible to eliminate uncertainity altogether, but one can minimize it to the best of their ability. After one point, you don't have control over your results. 

It's like preparing for questions on the Fast Money Round on Family Feud! You never know when one of your answers is gonna go viral :P

So am I nervous about the exam? Yes.

Am I freaking out about the results? Yes.

Am I confident I'll do the best I can? Yes!

So here goes nothing. Tie game. Buzzer beater from wayyy downtown. All I can do is embody my inner Steph Curry.
